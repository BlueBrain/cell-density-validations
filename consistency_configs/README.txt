Configuration files to use for validating cell densities for circuit building

Note the README at the root of the repo with instructions how to customize the configuration files for specific runs.
Below an explanation of the individual validations and their rationale:



Validation of consistency of "input" densities
CONFIG: consistency_checks_density_inputs.json

This refers to the densities generated by Dimitri's algorithms, i.e. VIP, SST, PV, etc.; but also various glia types.
I compiled a list of various logical consistency checks.
I call them "input" densities, because these files are the input for the next step, generation of "output" densities.

Validation of consistency of inhibitory "output" densities
CONFIG: consistency_checks_inh_density_outputs.json, consistency_checks_inh_density_outputs_tar.json

This refers to the densities generated by Yann's algorithms, i.e. individual inhibitory mtypes, such as L4_MC.
I compiled a list of logical consistency checks, such that inhbitory types add up to the prescribed "GAD" density.
I added separate checks for each cortical region, i.e. we validate that the constraints are not just fulfilled on average,
but also in subregions.

The version with _tar performs the same checks, but reads the .nrrd volumes directly from the .tar archive that Yann created

------------

Validation of consistency of excitatory "output" densities
CONFIG: consistency_checks_exc_density_outputs.json

This refers to the densities generated by Hugo's algorithms, i.e. individual excitatory mtypes, such as L4_MC.
It's essentially the same as above, just for excitatory instead of inhibitory m-types. Validation also region-per-region.

------------

Validation of placed cells
CONFIG: circuit_test_all_densities.json

This validates that the densities of actually placed neurons of various types match the prescriptions.
Validations are performed region-per-region and for individual m-types. But not both at the same time, as that would lead
to a rather large number of individual tests.
